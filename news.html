                <p>The High Council of Infrastructure has confirmed that the final rail-clamps have been magnetized. Otranti and Fellant City will soon be connected within a 50-minute transit window via the Otranti Line. This high-speed vacuum rail will bypass the dangerous wind-shears of the Great Step, ensuring safe passage for thousands of citizens daily.</p>
