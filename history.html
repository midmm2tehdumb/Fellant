                <p class="lore-intro">The history of Oros is a story written in blood, oxygen, and the heavy weight of gravity. It is the record of a world that was never supposed to be lived on, a people who refused to die, and the change of an entire solar system into a fortress of power. To the modern Fellant people, there is no known history before their time on Oros. The planet stands as a geological and biological anomaly, where the environment itself dictates the laws of survival and the structure of society.</p>
                
                <h3>THE STAR FALL & THE MYTH OF URTH</h3>
                <p>
In Fellant culture, the Star Fall is the vague, legendary beginning of everything. Because there is no record of how life began on Oros, everything before the first mountain cities is lost to time. Folklore says that the ancestors came from another land across the stars, but no ships have ever been found and no data from that time has ever been restored. There are no crash sites to visit and no rusted hulls buried in the ice. It is as if the people simply appeared on the peaks with nothing but their lives and a fading memory of a place they could no longer reach.
Legends speak of a world called Urth, a name that seems like a fairy tale to anyone living on Oros. The stories describe Urth as a paradise with a soft atmosphere and a sky that stayed a quiet, solid blue all day long. In these myths, Urth had vast oceans of liquid water and forests of green plants. Modern Fellant usually thinks of this as a story for children. To an adult living in a world of metallic dust and crushing pressure, the idea of a blue sky is scientifically impossible. In the myths, Urth was a home lost to a great war, but in reality, there is no proof it ever existed. The Fellant simply know that Oros is their only home, and the sky is their only master.

                <h3>THE GREAT STEP</h3>
                <p>Oros is a world defined by a single geological feature. This is the Great Step. Formed during the planet's erratic cooling, this massive ridge was forced upward by buckling tectonic plates until it pierced the stratosphere. The Great Step is a vertical wall 22 kilometers high that runs along the equator, effectively splitting the planet in two.
To the north of this wall lie the Northern Peaks. This is a jagged land of mountains where the majority of the Fellant population lives. To the south lies the Southern Hell, a high pressure, heated wasteland. While the Fellant are biologically capable of surviving in the south, it remains a relatively uninhabited wilderness. The southern air is a thick soup of metallic dust where the normal heat reaches 50 degrees Celsius. However, during the summer solstice or in the hottest spots, temperatures can soar to 100 degrees Celsius, with a punishing average of 70 to 80 degrees. Fellant teams occasionally descend the wall into the southern basins to gather rare resources, but they always return to the safety of the northern mountain cities.

                <h3>LIFE AND THE NORTHERN PEAKS</h3>
                <p>While the south is for industry, the Northern Peaks are for life. The Fellant have built their entire civilization inside the biggest mountains of the northern hemisphere. These are the Silo Cities, massive vertical hives carved directly into the rock. By building inside the mountains, the Fellant are protected from the Diamond Rain and the extreme temperature swings of the surface.
Living in the peaks of the north is the standard for Fellant citizens. These cities are self-sustaining ecosystems that stretch miles down into the mountain roots. The upper levels of a silo city might experience temperatures as low as -50 degrees Celsius, while the lower levels near the geothermal cores remain warm and regulated. These cities are marvels of engineering, designed to keep millions of people alive in an environment that would kill any other species in minutes.

            <section id="energy">
                <h3>ENERGY ON FELLANT</h3>
                <p>The sky over Oros is never truly dark. It is always lit up by the Eternal Aurora. These are glowing curtains of green, purple, and blue light caused by the planet's magnetic field hitting the metal dust in the air. While it looks beautiful, it is actually a deadly power source. The aurora creates static storms that are so strong they fry any technology that is not specifically protected. These storms act as a natural shield, making Oros a graveyard for any outside ships.
However, the aurora is a main power source for the Fellant. Their silo cities are tuned to the frequency of the planet so they can pull electricity right out of the sky. This harvested energy is what keeps their life support running and their air filters spinning. Without the aurora, Fellant civilization would go dark in a matter of days.
                </p>
<p>Because the surface of Oros is a high pressure environment with extreme heat, the Fellant do not rely only on the sky for energy. Deep beneath the crust, the planet is still active and churning with heat. The Fellant have drilled deep into the rock to tap into geothermal power.
These geothermal plants are built into the roots of the northern silo cities. They use the intense heat of the planet’s core to create a secondary power grid. This ensures that even if the sky is calm and the aurora is weak, the cities will have enough power to keep the population alive. This combination of drawing power from the sky and heat from the ground makes the Fellant cities some of the most energy efficient structures in the known system.
</p>
<p>
Another resource is because of the vast amount of Helium-3, Fusion reactors are common and provide a high amount of energy. Typically used on ships or places where the Auroras dont reach, fusion can be a staple energy source for Fellant cities.

            <section id="resources">
                <h3>RESOURCES OF FELLANT</h3>
                <p>The planet is saturated with materials that are rare in the rest of the galaxy, but the distribution of this wealth is tied to the Great Step. In Southern Hell, the very ground is a treasure. The sand in the southern basins is composed of 40% special materials, mainly rhodium and iridium. These heavy elements make the surface a shimmering, metallic desert of immense value.
Perhaps most surprisingly, the very peaks of the tallest mountains found in the south are composed of almost solid Helium 3. Because these southern peaks are saturated with this fuel source, they are the primary targets for Sovereignty resource expeditions. Harvesting Helium 3 in the south is a brutal task, as workers must manage the equipment in temperatures that fluctuate between extreme heat at the base and freezing cold at the higher altitudes. This concentration of rhodium, iridium, and Helium 3 in the south makes it the industrial engine of the system, even if it is too hostile for permanent civilian life.
</p>
                <p>Water is a precious resource on Oros. On most of the planet, the high heat and pressure mean that on the surface, water exists only as vapor mixed with metallic dust. Liquid water is almost impossible to find on the surface. Instead, the Fellant must look to the highest points of the Northern Peaks.
Near the summits of the highest mountains, the temperature drops low enough for water to freeze into massive glaciers. These peaks act as the planet’s only water towers. The Fellant have built complex systems to harvest this ice, melting it down and filtering out the Diamond Rain minerals. This water is then piped down into the silo cities. In Fellant culture, water from the highest peaks is considered the purest, while the moisture found in the lowlands is seen as a toxic sludge.

                <h3>ADAPTATION: THE DUAL ASPIRATION</h3>
                <p>The Fellant were not born as they are now. They were changed by thousands of years of survival. Without the help of ancient technology to guide them, the first people on Oros either adapted or they died. It was a mathematical process of elimination. Those who could not process the metallic dust died from internal bleeding. Those who could not handle the extreme temperature swings from 100 degree heat in the south to -70 degree cold on the northern peaks simply perished.
Over many generations, their bodies changed. They developed a dual aspiration system. They have High Lungs used for the thin, cold air of the mountain tops and Basin Filters used for the thick metal air of the lowlands. Because Oros is so stingy with its oxygen, the Fellant evolved to be efficient, requiring very little oxygen to operate at full capacity. Their skin also became thick and silver tinted because of the iridium they absorbed. This skin acts like armor that protects them from the Diamond Rain.

                <h3>THE DIRECTORATE REVOLUTION</h3>
                <p>Modern history began with the arrival of the Directorate. They were an industrial empire from a distant star system that saw Oros as a mining site. The Directorate built industrial elevators that stretched along the Northern Peaks to reach the mountain cities. They treated the Fellant as biological tools, forcing them to mine dangerous areas while the Directorate officers lived in pressurized bunkers.
The war lasted for a decade. It began with small acts of sabotage and ended in a total revolution led by a figure named Aurelius. Aurelius realized that the Directorate’s greatest weakness was their reliance on their technology. They were terrified of the Great Step and never left their suits because they could not handle the pressure or the extreme temperatures. Aurelius organized a massive, secret climb. Thousands of Fellant scaled the 22 kilometer wall using only their bare hands. They moved through areas where the air was too thin for any Directorate soldier to breathe.
When they reached the top, they seized the orbital defense platforms. They sabotaged the air regulators in the Directorate’s strongholds, flooding the bunkers with raw, rhodium filled air. The Directorate soldiers choked on the very air the Fellant breathed as a birthright. The Directorate was completely erased from the system, and their technology was reclaimed to build the Sovereignty.

                <h3>THE KRIOS SYSTEM FORTRESS</h3>
                <p>With the Directorate gone, the Sovereignty turned the entire Krios system into a fortress. Krios 1 is a planet so close to the sun that it is tidally locked. The Sovereignty turned this into the Solar Forge, using the permanent heat of the sun facing side to refine metals and build their fleet. Krios 3 is a frozen rock on the edge of the system that serves as the Watch. It is a lonely post where soldiers monitor sensors to see if an enemy fleet is approaching. Because of the static storms on Oros, the Watch on Krios 3 is the only way to get a clear signal from deep space.

                    <section id="military">
                <h3>THE WAR & MILITARY OF FELLANT</h3>
                <p>The best soldiers in the Sovereignty wear Black Glass armor. It is made from dark volcanic glass reinforced with a metal lattice. This armor reflects the heat of the basins and the radiation of the peaks. It is also designed to be acoustically silent. A soldier wearing this armor can stand perfectly still on the 22km peak of the Great Step and will not show up on radar or be seen by the eye. They look like a shadow against the neon glow of the aurora.

The only group that the Sovereignty has trouble with is the Vanguard. These are Fellant exiles and criminals who hide in the dead zones of the Great Step. They live in the deep canyons at the base of the 22km wall, where the pressure is at its highest and the heat is most intense.
The Vanguard acts like a massive criminal gang, stealing Helium 3 and kidnapping citizens. Because they have the same tough biology as the regular Fellant, they can hide in the cracks of the planet where the Sovereignty’s laws are hard to enforce. The Sovereignty treats them like a pestilence, avoiding a total war to save resources for defending the whole system.
