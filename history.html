                <h3>THE STAR FALL & THE MYTH OF URTH</h3>
                <p>In Fellant culture, the **Star Fall** is the legendary beginning. Folklore suggests ancestors came from a land called **Urth**—a paradise with a soft atmosphere and forests of green. To a Fellant adult living amidst metallic dust, a "blue sky" is scientifically impossible. With no crash sites or rusted hulls ever found, it is as if the people simply appeared on the peaks.</p>

                <h3>THE GREAT STEP</h3>
                <p>Formed during erratic cooling, this 22-kilometer vertical wall splits the planet at the equator. North lie the **Northern Peaks** (Life); South lies the **Southern Hell** (Industry). The Southern basins are a shimmering desert of 40% rare materials like **Rhodium** and **Iridium**.</p>
                <div class="lore-note">
                    <strong>RESOURCE DATA:</strong> Southern peaks are composed of almost solid **Helium 3**, the primary fuel source for the Sovereignty.

                <h3>ADAPTATION: THE DUAL ASPIRATION</h3>
                <p>The Fellant evolved to survive. They possess <strong>High Lungs</strong> for thin mountain air and <strong>Basin Filters</strong> for the thick metallic air of the lowlands. Their silver-tinted skin, infused with Iridium, acts as armor against the Diamond Rain.</p>

                <h3>THE DIRECTORATE REVOLUTION</h3>
                <p>Led by the hero **Aurelius**, the Fellant rose against an industrial empire that treated them as tools. Aurelius exploited the Directorate’s fear of the Great Step. Thousands of Fellant scaled the 22km wall with bare hands, sabotaging air regulators and flooding Directorate bunkers with raw, rhodium-filled air that the Fellant breathe as a birthright.</p>

                <p>Post-war, the system became a fortress. <strong>Krios 1 (Solar Forge)</strong> refines metals via solar heat, while <strong>Krios 3 (The Watch)</strong> monitors deep space signatures through the atmospheric static of the Eternal Aurora.</p>
